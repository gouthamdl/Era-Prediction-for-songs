Era-Prediction-for-songs
========================

Done as part of the Machine Learning course (CS689), the purpose of the project is to classify songs
into different eras based on various features. Initially we tried classification using lyrics but this
gave pretty low accuracy so we instead used the loudness, timbre and pitch values for each song. 
We used the Million Song Dataset. The implementation was done in Python using sklearn.
